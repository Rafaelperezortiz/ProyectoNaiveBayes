improve tapai ko app dheri ramro ra upayogi xa tara loading dheri nai chahe jati nai fast net vaya pani  hope so yo problem chadainai slove hunxa vanera  thank you
what is the point of having the jackpot when we spin the wheel if i never get it i mean has anyone ever got the jackpot if not i think it is completely pointless and should be taken off
if chat at wechat no simbol or bluetick seen so we do not know if we have been reading text or not so i hope this apps can do diffrent thing right now
uninstalled i downloaded this app thinking it would soon be supported with google for log in and sync with chrome web version cannot or will not do two separate  apps for a to do list       will give 5 star when this is a reality
excellent                                                                                                                                      application                                                                              develop
richard perez like it moved it to sd card and could not get it back now trying to re download for like three hours out of high speed data and cannot connect to wifi do not know why or if download going to be complete should have waited before i rated it four stars
it sucks right now the special  levels are rigged  i am sure you cannot win just waste your lives and boster f it ready to un install it
not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just will not respond  it does not seem to be fixated on a certain website or so  it happens at random  it is far much better than before  and yes it is not my phone s fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone  no problem there
privacy its nice how it works with the agenda of your smartphone but  i think they might do something for contacts that did not have the app and you want them block if they download the app     the same way they give you the option for send invitations  they should have the option for block them
what the heck   cannot get status updates to be in chronological order   half of my comments do not post   it worked fine before the last update   keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason   will not let me tag people without their name being all jumbled  if i edit a post  it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed  i am 2 seconds away from uninstalling
galaxy note 4  note 10 1 tab   tab 3 7 0 it is getting better much better but keep working on it especially the talk texting  also  what did you to google voice please  please  please fix wth can only text   receive text from google voice really              i can facetime from contacts w 4g lte   new update 5 1 1 please do not mess it up with marshmallows 6 0 if it is not broke please stop trying to fix it  google you are making me want to come out of retirement and come work for you guys
whatsapp tips make it as a medium  not base for a friendship  do not stop talking if your friend is not online  find other ways to interact this way even if whatsapp not available  friend will exist
is a shame that when you share picture with your contact all people that has google account sees all the pictures and those pictures supposed to be a private picture that was shared between contact
jill you have lost all my photos i push drop box and you tell me to set up a new dropbox  all is gone  return my photos will look again tomorrow  bad service people
unstable call connection it is showing an unstable call connection message on screen whenever i try to call my dear ones  then it is getting worse and leading into self disconnection of calls  i hope you guys notice it and make sure the problem should be solved
no notification displayed on system notification panel     after the latest update of version 2 12 367 in asus zenfone 5  i am not able to get notifications of the new msgs received in the notification panel on the upper side  it does not get displayed   plzz see to it coz i do not get notified when the msgs have been received  bothering me much
bugs  bugs  and more bugs with each update  if you are unable to improve something which was already good  then do not      it up  google talk    notifications bugs are all over the place  edit  application must be reloaded ultimately to be able to view messages   edit  now crashes all day long and requires phone reboot each time
new message notification fault it does not notify you of new messages real time  you can only identify new messages if you open the app  therefore  you can not respond to messages real time
it sucks  i am always shown offline and unable to send a single message  to my team
awsome great  type of social media nothing wrong with it it used to crash on my phone but since the update its does not even lag a bit pleaz get
fastest browser it is fast  it is reliable  the only problem i have with it  it do not like to download video s or game s  so both video s   game s it goes to the site just no downloads come up   also the lil emoji s that have action to them  it do not show their lil action  i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all  i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser  maybe the fastest  so please fix those bugs
it is alright     i do not get to go on the cross wire i have got to 200 000 why why why                                                          i forgot to tell you no sound on this game         i hate it
ads for some whatever reason sometimes  which is more then you think  would open and show me some security ad  i am not even clicking on chrome and this still happens  plz fix this annoying thing
complete bull was on 1186 and went to play and had lost all my boosters had over 100 different boosters saved up some i payed for never again
on sgh i727 android 4 1 2 the new platform showing all contacts reduced your rating not just like the online status that does not give us option to identify our contacts that are online without having to tap on contacts one by one to see there  individual online status and without necessarily having your disable enable our personal settings  useless option that does not work    frustrated users ratings going lower and lower  loosing your edge specialy with no response from you  other than the automated generic in privaye email
brilliant  the best application i have found so far for team collaborations
rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish it is very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it does not do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory    need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers    never will i use drop box again    people out there check other clouds e g  one drive  gmail drive  just other drives    very dissapointed with dropbox
privacy you must provide system in which no one should be able to download profile image  moreover if there will be video calling option then 5 rating is must  kindly do the needfull
something is missing is there a possibility to have your troops have the  winter  theme  like having the wizards red cloaks or max lvl balloons with red colored balloon and pekka that is literally a sword wielding snowman  its worth it  to add those features rather than just making it snow while covering some buildings with snow
i cannot see my h you d  on my screen anymore ever since the new update my screen does not show up the images it used to now all i see are words floating in thin air with no back ground to it       not sure how to get help with this or  to unis tall and re install
cannot use not being able to call any contact please try to fix  then ill give all stars
trust worthy as always  have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops  now using it on my android phones as well  not settling for any other second rate browser
this update sucks    i cannot open the game anymore  just crashed  damn it  i have an on going war but the app will not run    if there is a half star option to rate this  i would give you that  fix this as soon as possible
when you will add gif support  i will give you 5 stars   edit  gif support added indeed  here is your 5 stars
not happy with this app not one of my life or ticket requests come through    i get notified on fb that people have sent them  then when i open the app there is nothing there   having to pay to get to the next level really sucks
no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phone s contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data  the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data  linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves  it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed
messages are not sending or receiving right away poor excuse for an instant messaging app  needs to send messages instantly  tried reinstalling app and switching to both data   wifi connection without success
i hated it i am able to log in successfully but after some days    there comes the message saying   unfortunately twitter has stopped  first time i let it go then again the next day comes the same message  i reported then again let it go  then the next day comes again the same message  i cannot tolerate it this message comes more than 15 times a day  when i start browsing on twitter  there comes again   truly why are you creating this type of stupid social networking sites if it is nawt useful
good app for free this is a great collabo app  especially since it is free   i asked for 2 things and slack delivered  1  proper gif viewing 2  ability to change profile pic from app   functionality complete
not so good remove all contacts please    a lot of people hate that soooo much    it is boring and ugly    till i find wanted contact need to search for it 2 minutes
glitch  not working on galaxy note 5 this is my third time downloading on my note 5  which is less than 1 week old  worked perfectly on the note 4  what happens is that at first  right after install  it works good  then  i am not able to touch the top lefthand icon which gets me to all my channel options  so  i am installing again
two stars cuz after the update it is not working properly it remains connected but when i send a message it is automatically disconnectec and ths message takes aprrox 2 mins or more to send   plz fix this prob as soon as possible   tnx
z2 put direct exit button  when use back button its very difficult to exit from some sites like bank or other password protected sites  i m going to disable crome from my fhone  i cannot directly exit from crome  i have to use back back till all tabs not closed

stay on your toes with a new issue every month every time i solve an issue with this app  a new one seems to crop up  recently i stopped receiving sms from my husband who uses google voice  went through the troubleshooter which directed me to make sure his messages are not ending up in the spam folder  well  that is only accessible from the desktop app  you cannot even view spam messages from the android app  or the mobile website  gtfohwtbs
all nepali must use
big problem new update showing all contact and there is no setting for this prob do sum thing fastly
load shedding widget not syncing the load shedding widget does not sync  otherwise the app is awesome for me
does exactly what it states  thank you
there is a draught in th11 supercell needs to fix the draught caused by this update  this game is no longer fun  there is no loot to upgrade or donate  let th11s hit lower level bases  dead bases are dead  we are not wiping them  just going for collectors  this is the only way
great simple and great apps for news lover  i always used to read news from ekantipur website  but now this has made my task times easier  thanks to the developer

boo  it loads slow even on my hardware  considering kmg is the leading news company   the interface is very poor  i your app is almost like direct links to your websites  and the difference between the low resolution and high resolution files in e paper is not perceivable at all
would like to see who are currently online  performance of the latest app has deterioted  where is the list of online friends  one of the most important aspects of gtalk which never let me shift to other chats is the fact that i can know who all are online and i can chat with  by chat i mean i can get replies and have a conversation   please incorporate this feature at the earliest so that i can install this back
personal break do not mind the break necessarily   but i do not think its necessary   especially during gem boost time   would like to not be told when i cannot play lol
backing up of messages i dnt know why you even added that message back up  since morning anytime i open my whatsapp a pop up appears backing up my messages which makes me not to be able to read my messages  you could have done it in a way that it work in the background but not popping and thus preventing you from reading your messages   pls  stop  that

posting issues for the last week  there is been a ghost post at the top of all my feeds from when i uploaded a photo  closing the app fully has not fixed it  and it does not happen on any other platform  trying an uninstall to fix it
very useful for watching tv reading saptahik kantipur
i do not like the new shield system  your base is 100 percent destroyed but the attacker did not deploy one third of his troops  so you would not get any shield  it does not make any sense to me  i personally do not think shield should be depend on no of troops used
the new updates are cool but     whenever i try to favourite a tweet now  it closes the app saying unfortunately  twitter has stopped  maybe it is just my android i do not know
frozen world   changed stats i love this game  now with the frozen verison up and running  finally got to a high score of 8 736 101 with no save me and my stats had  not changed  when get past 12 million  screen starts going slow and skipping along as if still downloading while running through the forest  please fix  not cool
fix or i quit do not download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers  the game will not load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play  not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies  i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play  fix these issues or i am done but from what i see in the other comments i do not think the developers even care
some problems on showing pics after download android 5 1 1 can wechat team have the troubleshooting procedure  i viewed the previous standard tips from wechat tencent  it did not work at all
download stops the iteam iam downloading stop half way or about 13 percent or it just does begin at all  please fix this and ill rate it 5 stars
ads way to many ads cannot even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch  every other level there is an ad  that is just ridiculous
great game  too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time  unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game  unless you get ad free  be prepared to get ads up the butt
nice app
always fun  but    i like this new frozen shadows  but the depth perception is not so good  it is hard to see an approaching corner  other then that small bug  i love this game and will continue to play it
it is all awesome  can you devs please add more emojis when you have time    no hurry  keep up the good work  lt 3
angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill  the player may become frustrated  but is never bored  i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time  most adverts allow a skip click
organization logo whenever i try to add my organization  on my status it displays linkedin s organization logo  however on my profile the logo is not there and it looks very plain  can someone explain to me why this may be happening    this is on a desktop  by the way
great but    lags waay too much  i always end up wasting gems when i die because it was lagging  please fix
poor data wifi transition still does not work with wifi networks  even the socket http protocol does not help  please learn from whatsapp
not enough space 6g is nothing these days  need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller  please do not go to that material crap      not evertone likes the cheap material design  it is designed for lazy devs who like the easy lazy way
good app   i like dis app  very useful i loved it                      dis app is awesome and very useful     dis app never makes me disappointed and very simple to use
no longer a casual game the current version of the game makes it too hard to play casually anymore  expect to spend 4 6 hours a day  just to stay afloat
very useful i have not used it as much as i could  but even for what i do  evernote is one of my favorite apps of all time  they just keep making it better and better  their widgets make the all even cooler
still the best mini i like the new look and news front  very fast and efficient  though for overall best all around browsers id go with maxthon  yandex and uc   but for mini s opera mini gold though uc mini is coming along strong     minuses  needs an adblock
contact image disappears i do not know y i cannot c the newly added contacts pliz fix dis i will give you 5 stars straight away
it is ok     only 1 request    its been now more than 1 2 yrs for whts app but desperately waiting for feature which shows active or live whts app users from contacts  if whatsapp add this feature  then 101  sure whatsapp will rock
i enjoy twitter but i am extremely annoyed that i cannot swipe left or right through an accounts twitter pictures as easily as before  now just tapping the picture takes me to the whole tweet  i have to be super cautious to not accidently tap the picture while i am swiping  it is incredibly annoying  please go back to how it was before  if i were to want see the whole tweet just touch the caption
umm     while this game has gotten kind of old  and i have basically replaced it with the soda saga game  i still like playing this but for some reason  for i do not know how many days now  every time i go to open this game it will load a little and then crash closed  fix please

this update completely destroyed my facebook  it loads to the status screen but once i try click anything at all or scroll the app goes to my home screen  it does not even say force close  it just does it so i load it again and finally begin scrolling but not even 5 scrolls later the app closes     this never happened before i updated fb
edit  wakelock has been fixed  thanks       i used to love this app  but the latest version is holding massive wakelocks and burning through my battery   would be 5 stars without this but essentially unusable now   please fix this battery hog and it will be a 5 star app again

not what i expected i really thought that the new updates will make the app better  but instead it became worst  i am sorry to say that  and i wish if you put this review under consideration  and make the newest update better
amazing upgrade  love the upgrade in the game  just when i thought this game could not get any better  it exceeds my expectations  good job guys
fun  addicting game i have played this game for so long  i have everything  there is no way i can complain about a free game  my only wish is that there was a reward for completing the frozen artifacts challenge  i think this happened one other time too but oh well  still a fun game
currency convertor not working  it only shows nepali rupess in both the spaces   refuses to change  was working fine before  pls fix this
good job but     please reduce its size  running services should consume less memory in background   in new version there is no option to show only viber accounts in contacts menu  it shows all contacts only   blocked contacts should be invisible after blocking show only allowed contacts  thanks
1 of our 2 favorite games  it is a delight playing this modern classic that is constantly renewing our interest
meh    hope it supports dual sim when used as default sms manager  and hangouts running very slow when opening a conversation
it is been 1 or 2 months and you all still have not fix the this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone l attack   there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc   can no longer protect my loot and no shield
not able to play  automatic closing since last two updates  not abke to play game  it closed suddenly in between automatically
you do not say what the updates are please take 1 minute and tell us what and why we are updating and not leave the same old message there
garbage  no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar  it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens  also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason  still no pdf support   finally  stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram  overflow menu is a cluttered mess
yo hamro keyboard chai computerma pani banauda ramro hunthyo  tara i love it n thanks for this  i support you all
latest update should be clientside the most recent update added the following features which need to be changed to client side only  colour  nicknames  and emoji  all three change the appearance of the chat stream and are community controlled  these are issues because they change everyone is layout  they need to be controlled by every individual of their own choosing
i want the old theme back      this theme is awful  previously opera mini was the best browser but now i think it is worst  no  i do not want to see the news or anything  just return the old opera mini back  you just make it awesome to awful
where is my boosters  after the update all the boosters i gained has gone  i had more than 100 boosters from each and now you took them all  why
the best game about they do not call this the no 1 app for nothing  its the original and best clean game about  one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling  funny though  i thought they had wings   it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come   it is as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s  it is so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it  for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future  the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet  but thankfully  the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline
temple run 2 frozen shadows i love this game so much i love being in the ice but only one thing that i hate about it is that the monster goes infront of you when your running but as you go further into the game it gets harder but able to pass the monster
makes everything so easy slack is easy to use and has all the right  ridiculously well polished  features  and it is backed by a genuine  caring and honest team  it almost seems like they want you to be happy even  after  you give them your money  crazy
two stars it used to work really well and the colors and nicknames and emojis are really cool and the snow and the hearts when sending some emojis are really cool  but the last update really s   s  cannot use any other app when using the chat heads  youtube stops when using the chat heads  the message sending is slow  sometimes it does not even feel that i am connected to the internet and sometimes cannot even send the messages  please fix it as soon as possible
cannot log into it tried to reset my password and i cannot do it  says that the reset key is expired or not valid   i have all my pictures there
ui   customization dark theme and color options  reply directly from the notification panel  options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps  please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge  write a message area is too cluttered  make it simplistic with a   sign  replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to
err    how do i back up and restore chat history  i used to be able to do that in older versions  why would you remove such a crucial feature   even after trying to backup using windows wechat  you have no idea where the backup is  it says backup on phone  but where on phone   if it is on the phone s internal storage then that is useless to me  because i need to wipe it clean to reinstall the system  if it is on the sdcard  then where   comparing to the backup restore feature of whatsapp  wechat s is an absolute joke
great app  i mainly use it to keep the team together cross sites
need swipe between images nice app  but it would be really nice if you could swipe between images when viewing them full size
i cannot send or read a message from facebook because the message icon has gone  it replaced by a messenger icon on top  so everytime i received a message i have to go to browser to see it  because i do not have a messenger app  and sometimes i cannot even read a message at all because i do not always have a wifi connection   i really hate it since i have been using mobile data sometimes  hope yu can fix it soonest
image search on verizon ellipsis 10 tablet does not function properly when an image search is conducted images appear in gray scale or b w with a checkered background
its getting there  i used to be a chrome opera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang  firefox memory consumption is far less and it is more stable  however  i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection  i use 4g and bandwidth are not a problem  i know you can fix it but i will give you 4 stars for now  thanks for the awesome  browser
not a fan of new update new update makes it difficult to progress unless you attack several times during your shield period   i cannot get ahead  i play twice a day if i can   cannot commit to getting on 4 6 times a day
either make the moving forward process 3 bars or less time to wait you need to change the peramiters to move to the next episode    tired of waiting 3 days as you paid people up with other people who no longer play
not good its previous version  12 0 0 15 14  is much good than that  i cannot text directly with current version  please add the inbuilt messenger again in the app
ever so useful evernote it is so easy to  scribble  something down when you have your smart phone  tablet  laptop  or whatever   you can be spontaneous  yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time   when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you   almost magical   such a time saver and a memory keeper
i found this app very fruitful   and m using it but can you please tell me how to write
very good apps    obviously  no doubt it is very useful apps for those who loves nepali language and want to write nepali   thanks for it n waiting another useful apps like this

the translation are very hilarious the translations from chinese to english do not make any sense at all    is there any chance we can edit ourselves after noticing it does not translate properly
annoyed whatsapp used to work great   but with the recent update messages did not want to come through unless i went into the app  i assumed it was my phone but samsung said everything is working great  so i was advised to uninstall and then reinstall whatsapp  i did just that  it picked up my old number and backed everything up  until it got to the initiating please wait a moment page it is been 3h now and nothing has changed  is there any way to solve this  i would really like to get back online

multitab button on top right side is missing    so you cannot switch between multiple tabs easily bcoz the small box on the top right corner  that tells you how many tabs r open  is not there any more  also  when you play video in a website  the audio and video will not be moving at the same speed  meaning the video frams will move ridiculously slow while audio plays at regular speed  i guess that is the problem with the flash player  overall poor web experience with this browser

funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise
not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of  no benefits either  issues begin to arise  and multiply exponentially  upon applying any changes  if using a text size other than the default a substantial lag reloading begins to occur when scrolling  zooming in  or out  causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank  also  in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras

how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different things  second make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use

hate it the new update shifted my tab in lower key    its just sooo irritating  tab looks good on chrome window only   i want tht bk
very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it   runs well during roaming and with low signal   i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group  so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion   just like in twitter etc   but within the group not public   would be great
best app i cannot believe that it is free  they treat it as if you paid for it
well done nicely designed      this app had collected daily used collection of apps    liked it
