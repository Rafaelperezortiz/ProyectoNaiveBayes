kill pages i will enter a url or open a new link and nothing loads  no loading bar  no error page   the page stays the same  also if i switch to a new tab  sometimes that will not load refresh  or if i switch back to an old tab the same thing happens
its really lovely apps   i am allready using a another mobiles   so knows that about facilities
used to be good everything was great  until i updated this most recent version  now  i am on facebook on my cell  it kicks me off  repeatedly  i try and like something  it takes several times tapping the screen before it even let us me    if i do not get kicked off   please fix this
for storage setting you guyz should work on storage options of whatsapp everything goes on internal memory i am not able to transfer my media files to sd card otherwise app is cool
please do something its too slow need update please add a feature to go directly in the start of every chat like whatsapp  we have to scroll for hours to go to top and when finally we are  there it just goes to the bottom    danm it  i would give 5 stars if someone solve this one please i am expecting a response
why cannot i share my achievements  recently discovered that there is a feature for sharing any kind of achievement  however i cannot accomplish it on my profile
poor customer service the heart button crashes the app whenever i hit it  has not been fixed ever since its introduction  within weeks my rate dropped to 1 star  unfortunately
excellent     awesome app very useful thanks forum  yes in connection with the previous suggestion if you can update along with planner it would much better
weather did not show please fix it
good
problem      thank you sir  your   speed mode off    idea works  now i can play video on you tube but one more problem is occur  whenever i tried to open any webpage suddenly a black   color screen appears  find solution for it
best browser in short size i cut 1 star because i am facing some issue in downloading two items at the same  1 item s downloading speed is good but another s speed is very slow
free the gifs not reliable on a slower network   messages frequently do not send
fix it dammit  why is my push notifications not appearing  i have 125 people enabled but i only get a tweet for every 5 minutes instead of all of them at the same time  i reinstalled the app countless times but they do not appear ar all  i have already missed 20 tweets in other 1 minute and i should have got notified for them all but i only got 1 for 1 tweet  fix this update i am not liking it
needs an actual update  twitter slows down  tweets continue to not even send  it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline  i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter
great little game  this is a great little game   i am completely addicted to this game   it is simple enough to learn  but has enough variety to keep you  interested   this is an ad supported game  just so you know   i would be happy to buy the game together rid of the ads  however i have not found where to do that yet
shab i have firefox on all of my devices and its more safer than the internet explorer  i like it i just wish it had more functions like free spyware  anti virus
good its very good to use     but i found some fualts    while writing lengthy status  the words which we enter at starting will not be visible  so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written    so make status editing line step by step instead a single line
my husband and i cannot send msgs to each other  it is saying on both ends that one other are not receiving msgs at this time   one messenger we cannot recover to see if msgs got blocked   help fix this
i love this guy  he keep updating this simple app  i think this app will rock soon
sucks the new update especially the multiplayer game bonuses sucks    please return to before system    only this time i am getting more loots but supercell stop it saying i am playing too long without shield then you got my village under attack and loose many of my loots    you are crazy
night mode this app is really good actually  but why the night mode does not work  what ashame
kind of like a 2d kingdom havoc fun   if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot  it would be close   angry birds is crazy good though   a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level   this game gets more difficult along the way  but it is cool to get better as you practice
utter garbage did not think i would be saying this as i am a firefox user myself  but the browser is utter garbage  i have got a samsung galaxy tab s2 and the browser crashes constantly  i am switching to a different browser
addictive   the only negative is that you are never given gold bars   you have to buy them
you should fix this it does nt work anymore  i do not know what to do  because everytime i open this app  it automatically closes and a pop up message says  unfortunately  facebook has stopped
all time legendary game the birthday party levels and short fuse levels are fantastic especially when the pigs crash onto different chemicals is just great suggestion to all those players who cringe about too much ads is close you are wi fi connection and then play the game then the ads will not trouble you
cannot switch back you have to go to phone setting to switch to another keyboard  you should add choose input method on keyboard  if i am missing it  teach me how to find that
i cannot see and upload my photo at the moment    why  before this  wechat no problem but now   why
this new update sucks    no more dead bases    supercell you have  to fix this and bring back those dead bases so that we can have higher loots    for now its impossible for us to upgrade anything  please fix this as soon as possible
i love the chrome version  only problem with this app is new tasks entered here go to inbox instead of today
best cloud provider love the flexibility  feature set  and streamlined setup  use it daily
ads placement is anoying we know ads was one of your source of income  but placing ads in replies is taking anoying and greed to another level  facebook had more ads  but have you ever see them in the comments section
all you need  easy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals  the software itself is great  and the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it  great job
disappointed first of all i would like to thank the creators of the uc browser for this is the best browser that i have ever used  now why 3 stars  because i was planning to download a game but uc browser cannot download it  the page loads but no downloads and i have to use mozilla because of this particular reason  i want to give you guys a five star but until you fix this i will just give you 3 star   thank you     just please help me with  this one i want to use only one browser
too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice  i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian  the new one is double the size and takes more space  it is not even as fast as the earlier one  what a shame  seems improved after update
we have a problem  so i have noticed that twitter will let me like nonspecific things until i am blue in the face  but liking certain specific things get me booted from the app and i have to log back in  let me repeat that  like certain specific things gets me logged out and i have to log back in  what is going on  twitter support
it is best app for regular news update  but    please add more news updates in nepali language too
great game  but too many ads almost not worth playing
works fine for the most part  not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not  i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices  i am usually logged in 24 7 on 2 computers and a phone
it was  working great   before  the bugs   worse   with the bugd  and without
error and only error i think this is the worst app made which does not load and mobile gets hang and full screen ads and in pdf format many error in spelling old one was very much better than this
great features  but my notifications do not work title says it all  the app says i should be getting the notifications on my phone but i am not getting any  would rate 5 stars if this was resolved
so unstable after daily updates had it 4 stars for a long time  this week there were daily updates and the latest one did not fix my problem  i get a pure white screen upon launch  that would be fine if this was a  flashlight app  i uninstalled and reinstalled  still a flashlight
love it        i love angry birds  i can sit and play on for hours upon end  love the challenges they threw at me
its just ok in news paper there alot of time to loaded even in wifi 512kbps
loved it        app                                                                                                                                Â…                                                                              inserting symbols  inserting pictures from the galary  wedding 1 2 3 etc  and phonetic symbols so the english learners could be helped more
extremely useful app  but has a tendency every so often to glitch out and eat half my battery before i realize what it is doing  also needs to let users define a cap on how much device storage it can hog  i recently discovered this app eating nearly a gig of my tablet s already scarce internal storage  all on its own  i now clear its data manually every few weeks to stop this
samsung galaxy s5 sm g900f always come back to chrome it just works on so many sites i use  better than the other browsers  but it does need this improved data savings update quick  and the malware blocking which may already be included now  i am not sure   more importantly it needs a ad blocker  but obviously this is going to effect google s business model  a chromium download please
temple run  pretty good the game is fun but i would like it if it did not have so many videos for one specific app most of the time  it would also be nice if you could choose to be a boy or a girl character  overall the game is okay pretty good
suggestion  i given 5 stars to this game   because i like it very much  but i have a suggestion to improve this game plz  when a color er bomb is mash with i striped candy  all of candies of the same color become striped and blast  but same action with tha rapped candy does not act like this  as works in candy crush soda saga  plz work on it  thanx  muhammad hanif karachi pakistan  no reply from admin  why
contacts and delays is it just me  with the new update  all contacts are showing up including those who are not using viber  the old version allows you to hide your contacts who are not using viber  i also that notifications on messages are delayed  pls fix this
definitely worth your time  there are too many lousy whiners reviewing this amazing app  if you are not happy  take a long hike douchebags
keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode  in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites do not load please fix this or i am moving to another browser
superb  all in one
issues setting up  works fine now had issues with registering verification email initially  eventually did it via the browser than the app  the app works fine now once set up  do like it
refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months  for those of you complaining about crashes  that is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly
this new update i have not signed into my google account on clash of clans  and since the new update i cannot log in  and cannot remove the game and download it again because then i will lose everything  please help me get my game to load
nice update really nice update this update is awesome  but the quick search is really usless  but its okay  keep up the good works
sort it out why can i not get my networks posts in recent order on my mobile app  on my pc it happens  why am i looking at post from 1day ago before  posts say happening 1 hour ago  this is so annoying  how do you sort it out  also your help centre on mobile  is not working hence i have had to resort to this  what is going on
every time i press the send button  a black background appears  this does not happen before the update  it sucks coz it forces whatever i am doing to stop  like watching videos
excellent app but still needs a bit more work   keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate   my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing  i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately  its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards   also like google keyboard  if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button  it would be really helpful   then it will get 5 stars  good stuff nonetheless
problem i am on a samsung galaxy s6 and now it seems like i cannot log in  telling me that my pswrd does not work and when i try to reset it says that the number is banned   really frustrating as i have been on for one day and i thought the app was amazing until now   please tell me how to fix this problem   this app is problematic and no one helps
does not work anymore before the last update it worked just fine on my tablet but now it will start to open then close down
excellent app  clearly a passion project  great work
very good i liked the app and it is ui but i think the app can be best if you add option to remind us about any program on radio so that i would not miss my fav programs like timepass        keep developing
video player issue guys  this is unbelievable    every time when i updated  my video player it does not work  now if i do full screen video start stops every 10 sec  is just imposible watch  i really do not know what kind of update is this  happens exactly the contrary that you affirm
use to be a 5 star app i gave this app 1 star and told them i would give more stars after they fixed a particular problem i was having  they fixed that problem  so i upped it to 4 stars  i would give 5  but i am not happy with the changes they made where i now have to use 2 hands to reach for the top of my screen for those functions they use to have on the bottom of the screen  this is the only browser i found that does not have to reload every page when hitting the back button  definite plus
less space is the magic a complete package with very less space  but still  i would love to see a bit modern design
cool app except the notifications freeze  so i have no idea of the upload status  even worse do not know if it even worked or safe to delete those files  becomes more of a broken app to me  another issue i wanted to create a new account for a friends new phone  exclaimed that 2 year 50 gig is available and it shows it is until after you waste time following all of your steps to get 250 mbs or something worthless  keep it honest
new theme its a fun game       its great to see some new items added to the game  the frozen shadows makes the new challenges a lot more fun
love it you are able to see celebrity tweets and get info you did not know    i love it
very good application ever dharai ramro app ho yo but kalo background malai aalikati man paren plz hamrokeyboard team lai yo bharema ali sochnuna maile anurodh garchu
old is gold i used to play this game a lot when iwas nearly in 4 std but even after 4 years when i am in 8 the this game still continues to be my fav   i really never get tired of playing this as you know now that this is my fav
videos and notifications my videos have not been working for a long time on this app  whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted  its black and white and all glitchy  i sometimes have no way of fixing it  next  i have not been getting notifications in the app  i get them on my status bar  but when i go on the app i do not get a little number by the bell
has potential could be better but it conts to crash after some use  love the web version though
i do not get notifications from people anymore  also  the number of notifications i got does not go away after i have checked it  it kind of just    stays there
text notifications do not work i loved hangouts  however  since a few months ago  i am not able to receive text messages notifications  it is really annoying  i receive voice calls and invites notifications  i have looked everywhere for the solution and was not able to solve my problem  i am giving up  i am so frustrated
bad app for a great site linkedin is great but the app sucks  i always have problems opening the app  most of the times it asks me to retry or try later because the feed never loads  there are a bunch of other bugs
good app   it is a good app for people especially student like me   but i just think that it would be better if it become more colourful  maybe not too colourful but more colour  it will be more attractive to student like me to use it  thanks for the app by the way
bookmark folders what happened to the bookmark folders  everything was organized like it was on my computer and now they are just on a list  kind of hard to find things when they are like that
preview not available i cannot view my ms office files  if this problem still exists  will it be more convenient to move all files to one drive
bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts  one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years   the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it   so  after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print  which you can only see after purchasing the tablet  dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices   this is sleazy and bait and switch   free  not subject to any compensation  encumbrance  repayment in kind  etc   because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services
a lil  more features to be included there should be a option so as to you the profile pic is not visible to everyone   because if you block people then they cannot even send you msges   and also more no  of people in a group  maximum should be 500
such an awesome game love it a really fun games definitely suggest any reader of this description to get it is so good you will enjoy the game and it does not feel like a waste of time afterwards it is very easy to play and it is very fun to find ways to knock down the building just by using one bird thoroughly recommend it it is very fun and you are so good so please download this game will be blessed
i do not know i cannot edit my posts  things such as my profile picture  when i edit it  it becomes grey and says that it is no longer available  please fix  i have an htc desire  will rate 5 stars shown fixed
bug fixes required this version is much better than the previous one in terms of ui design  and data compression  this version gives me at least 86  saving  the saved pages view is good  as well as the tab previews  please provide an option to disable vibration for the facebook push notifications  and fix the in built wikipedia search engine language  every time i search for something through it  the page appears in german  i have to manually go to the english version of the page and search  please fix this
force close it is been 1 or 2 months and you all still have not fix the error  i cannot play  it is always crash and force to close everytime i am online for 10 seconds
the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed  e g   using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile  also there are no fish once  you finish jelly levels  please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile
bolt i purchased bolt earlier in old phone   now i changed my phone   unable to purchase him again   clicked on bolt purchase but nothing pop upchurch    for bruce lee  when i clicked on purchase   its ok   please fixed   lt  lt  lt  this has been fixed   emailed me the instructions within 1 day   basically  go to currency   at the bottom press restore purchase  it not easy to find
not the same with my hand on my heart  i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great  the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success  unfortunately  this hame has suffered the same fate    it is no longer the brilliant game it once was    it is  an updated version  with none of the original stuff that once made it great
all these updates all these updates but still no improvement on high ram usage  it drained battery so much and my phone is very hot when using this messenger only  now there is even a sync issues too it will not sync when it supposed to
its suck  any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting  else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network  realy very suck
please add option to provide pdf versions to download in mobile tabs
apps error recently     my phone when wanted to post picture    the sorting is not from the newest    but showing the oldest and need scroll down until the end
only two stars because frozen shadow is not compatible to my device      why oh why        make it compatible please
firefox for android  ok  not full firefox  but a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices  firefox sync works well  bookmarks and search history transfer as expected  really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer
too many updates of too big size please only send updates that are really really necessary  last one 40 22mb   if every app   which it seems it is   keeps doing updates we all end up with no room on our devices  having 15mb of languages i am never going to use is a waist of memory
you do not have to go to your wall calender and turn the page for your month event   this apps is just awesome
could be so much better if they would stop making unneeded changes  while i love twitter  i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads  also there should be a quicker way to access your lists  like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome  and also i have heard that twitter is testing a non chronological timeline  that is the worst idea ever  if that is implemented without a way to turn it off  i will not use twitter anymore  honestly  if third party apps had push notifications  i would not use the official app at all  oh  and moments is dumb
boosters gone     last update took all my boosters   i am going to be patient for them to be restored   if not i will be uninstalling and moving on   not happy
buggy when i edit a post through the mobile app  that post freezes and even restarting the phone does not resolve   unfreeze  this does not happen via the desktop app on my pc  not did it happen with previous android app version
the only and major problem is it cannot provide real time notification   but i love the web desktop notification very much
absolutely the best for saving documents  forms  notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go   you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in   edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books   tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you do not have to worry about where you saved it   just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for   it is that easy
chrome since last update you cannot scroll down or up   the entire page blinks   blinks  hurts my eyes  ug  it is slower   freezes   too big    to download mp3 of many sites i have to use another browser   they will not download     mrsgwennd
viber s a r l  this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options  really nice app and pretty stable running  just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying  sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself  i recommend this app
life saver   i had to get my content from my iphone to samsung and could not find out how to do it  dropbox helped me to move it so i could sell my iphone right away  i still have everything thanks to dropbox
hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it  however adding some features will definitely make it the best app  following are few things observed  1  the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2  few letters were not available along with words  3  also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the   underscore  4  easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star
your new update sucks it is now impossible to loot 2m in 4 hours  wtf  are you kidding me supercell  no more dead bases and spent 500k to find a semi dead base with 180k loot  dafuq you
really cool and organized  the new update is really amazing  the widgets are cool  however  it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support  like hebrew  because when i want to add check box the text removed to the left   also  you need to add an option to change the size of the preview  do not like it is so small   and app animations would be nice  something else to your attention  i want to by the app  but it really  really  expensive  if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it
websites not loading or taking too long to load when i begin browsing the first webpage opens fast but sometimes websites do not load even if there is good mobile data connection but they load with opera mini  please fix this bug
tablet support any chance of getting tablet support anytime soon
really love the new game  but since this update the game keeps shutting down on my s5  please fix the glitch
very good one of the best app
everyone loves slack  count me among them
continually fails to upload files great when it works but i have had enormous trouble with getting it to auto upload from my phone  usually i have to uninstall then reinstall to get this function   which is the one that i use dropbox for the most   to work  very annoying
awesome voice quality the best in class audio  plz include group voice calls  only video calls have it  option to add another person between the call should be provided
good good for slow connection this uc minilite version does not take much space memory in ram  it is faster also than uc
just a tool for them to throw ads at you they use this app to electronically monitor your messages looking for key words  once it recognizes a grouping of words it will start to send adds to your news feed that are similar in subject to that of which your talking about in your conversations
i remember back when this was a   3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups  go back to what you used to be   rio ruined every other angry birds game
the app made me i am rating it because of a pop up on the app but i like twitter so i am going to give it 5 stars  the only thing i do not like is the fact that i cannot edit posts f ing instagram can but twitter does not have option wtf
best nepali typing apps 1 you can type any nepali text in eng and it will show suggestion of nepali words  2 you can copy it in sd card and transfer to your pc also and many more you will only know after installing it
malayalam font overlapping malayalam fonts are overlapping in facebook at speedmode  also automatically turn on facebook notification  if i  turned off  please fix it
makes top left of my screen unresponsive many lg v10 users lose the ability to tap the top left of their screen when this app is installed  this issue makes uses other apps impractical and sometimes impossible as this issue holds phones hostage  if fixed i will change my review to 5 stars
why is there so much space  there is so much white space and everything is so spaced out  also the notifications are always late
developers please read  i think there needs to be some kind of confirmation implemented when the  buy extra moves for 9 gold bars  button is clicked  i recently did not do so well on a level and i ran out of moves  when going to press  end game    i  pressed the extra moves by accident and it took 9 bars even though i had no intention of continuing  i felt hurt after saving them up for so long  please consider this
more than notes  just use it for notes  but it is a powerful app  like the checklist  but we use a shopping list program for that and sync with my wife s htc m8  may want to try sharing with this app soon  though
its really good but   not everyone in your address book is exactly a friend   sometimes you do not want certain people to see ua status or dps    even if you knw them well    so if there could be an additional feature like a favourite list or something like that i would give it a 5 star fo sure
very bad i use xperia x8 and i think this app sucks  it never logs in  no matter how many times i change the password it always says it is not the right one  it also is not categorizes as a safe app  since its certificate is different then its name  so the anti virus has to be off for it to connect  futhermore  it has no way to be sync ed to the google account that allows you acces on the internet version
my texts are not delivering  i have checked my internet connection   its working just fine  please fix it   i will give a 5  thank you
this update sucks    i cannot open the game anymore  just crashed  damn it  i have an on going war but the app will not run    if there is a half star option to rate this  i would give you that  fix this as soon as possible

no artifacts since 1 months artifacts stopped to appear    i have a mission to find it
nice   but one request    plz include  find text  option in page   as in pc s browsers we press  ctrl f  to find the text in the browser s page   there should be an option of video quality adjustment in settings
useful app very useful app in my opinion  note taking is great with voice recognition  being able to add pics brings a nice presentation aspect when sharing with a group  the functionality just needs to keep improving for the average person to be perfect
great way to stay organized i jot notes for work  family  shopping lists  music   things to do and stories or news feed i want to come back to  great place to store everything
pop up and search using image  i seriously hate that opera mini does not support pop ups  i need pop ups enabled  from where do i choose to enable it  i am forced to use uc browser due to this    and please provide an option in the long press menu to search using any image  please guys     we are waiting     reply atleast
loved it
twitter is great to connect with my classmates  as i am on exchange at the moment  however  i cannot view who is liked my posts  it will say there is 9 likes  but will only show me 3  also  the notifications are not very good  sometimes it will not tell me if someone has followed me or if they have liked retweeted one of my posts
good need to use every nepali peoples

i love it i love using uc browser mini because browsing speed of it is marvelous and mind blowing and the size of this app is so small  so overall i would like to say that size of it is small but the work of it is big and awesome
great app saves me when i am on the field because i do not have to rush back to my office to look at certain things

groups       edit  i changed my rating from one to three stars due to linkedin s response to my review  glad groups is still in the app but i do not iike that it is not as straightforward to access them as before

unfollow tool does not function unfollow controls do not work on my tablet for friends  i have to go to a pc based messenger to adjust this feature
the ads ruin my fav app i mean the ads for viber desktop  i dial my friend  start talking and what happens next is  my microphone turns off  speakers turn on and the browser starts launching  so my friend is saying something for everyone to hear because she cannot hear me and i am pushing buttons like crazy trying to stop browser from launching  it does take a while on my phone  what happens every time is that viber desktop ad launches about 3s after i make a call  that is the right way to stop me using the smartphone app
enjoying i am unable to delete items from the trash on either samsung phone or tablet   are you able to let me know how or make this available in an update sometime    thanks
not supported i am using panasonic t10 and frozen shadows are not supported  i will be very great full if you will fix this
really  i honestly ussd to love this app     now i realize it is honestly terrible  i still use it every so often but for sms  i suppose there is bulk in the programming but i can have 4g lte and be told i have no signal to send a text  you are better than this google
very good  esp with penultimate i really like the cross device syncing and how easy it is to use  please do not make this microsoft word  its great as it is  i esprcially like being able to work in penultimate and find it in evernote with everything else
still broadcast list did not improved you should improve back up option    you should give 2 options 1  with media   2 without media only chats
came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power  unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu
pls fix these bugs   when ever you  set the search engine as google it again automatically shifts to yahoo and yahoo is sick imean iam really fond of google so please    fix this bug
where is the option to separate viber contacts  can not see all viber contacts separately  it shows all together after last update  not so good  call drops   while having video call cannot hear other person properly
cannot log in since the latest update i am having trouble logging in  i cannot log in my account and it keeps on saying that my phone is not connected to the internet  but when i try open my browser it can connect to the internet  please fix this
another update and still crashing  previously tried    disabled add on  tried re installing  another new update    crashing every few minutes and still cannot sync data
whatsapp   free if you want an app that is basically the same and is free forever  get line  free calls   messaging    i personally like line more because you are able to get different stickers images to send in the chat
bullshit update    after updating its totally headache   nt able to download    instead of mobiles its more suitable as pc   when we search anything its always searhing for websites  previously it was asking sepearately for web n image search   apart from this dwnldng is tatal worst as compare to previous version
ads  ads and more ads i do not mind having ads but when it is a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me  i deleted this  i do not remember that many ads last time i played this  if you can handle ads all the time it is a fun game to play but no longer for me
the best mobile browser ever opera mini is still the best mobile browser in terms of data saving  however  the browser does not support gif animation image  it does not support themes  night mode is not impressive  saved pages should be accessed locally and transferable to other opera mini device browser  above all it is a good browser with beautiful ui  it is my number one choice browser  thumbs up guys
agree with new ui being too much like fb  also  there is literally no way to modify the app settings  the only option given is to view your linkedin apps  why was this removed  major necessity when you are getting spammed everytime someone posts an update
i do not have word to appreciate this       so just thank you verrrry very very very much founder of its
superfast  just as i remember it   opera mini was the  1 browser back in the days of symbian  glad to see it still up there  superfast  smooth  minimal data used  as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter   lag  even on simple pages with a few commercials
new user  great app  have suggestions so far  i love working with the app on all devices  desktop  web    android phone   it integrates very well with other related apps  however  i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things  1  allow check boxes bullet items to be easily re ordered  drag drop  it is kind of a big deal for me and 2  allow duplication of notes  if these functions already exist  then hopefully someone will share how to do it  or i will figure it out soon enough  and then i will gladly rate 5 stars  great job guys
updates poorly current update clears the cache forcing you to log in again  and of course i have not logged in in over three years and do not know the password   try to do a password reset and the app says the email is not valid   why would you clear auto login information in an update
awsome but i                                this game but i do not like the frozen bit my sister has had eye site and she can see the normal one and she cannot  see the frozen ones so she keeps dieing luckerly we can change back to the normal one but the frozen one takes longer to load so when the frozen whone is out the window i will rate 5 stars but the rest is awesome
good thank you for your previous reply  but i think you guys got me wrong  my friends are not able to endorse my skills and not the opposite  i do not know how to enable the endorsement
usefull no others app like this
glitch y i like this browser better than chrome in terms of its setup and function  but i wish it was less glitchy  the back button seems to just lock up the tab on a certain website    sad face
great features on firefox usually i use chrome that it is a great app  but now firefox upgrade with great features  include video player better and downloading  you can install and experience yourself  have fun and give them a great vote

will not authenticate i use the web app and wanted to have it on the go  it will not login  i checked my credentials and i can get in on the web  but not my phone
great app  but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android  it is fast and efficient  and all the addons are great  yet  the menu key problem ruins the app  firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button  the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes  and there is no way to force it
after you are latest update i and my friend made a video call after you are latest update video of my friend z vry clr bt voice cnt b heard of my friend so plz plz resolve dis problem plz plz its a kind request
the new app looks great and is very easy to use  however it is missing important features such as endorsing connections or writing recommendations  furthermore i hate the fact that job search is now in a separate app  why do i have to download 2 apps
lifesaver this app is the one i use to keep track of my christmas shopping  my 2015 christmas notebook has separate notes for each person  i can check the 2014 notes to make sure i do not duplicate   but i use it all year around for med lists for my mom  grocery lists   pictures i need   it is a lifesaver for my overworked memory

very good  but reposition and either fix or remove the  share link  button  the  bookmarks not syncing  issue was fixed a while back  i have been happy with this app for a while now  i just forgot to change my previous review  that is not to say that it is without its problems  however  having gotten used to chrome  i find myself pressing  share link  rather than  open link in new tab   while this normally is not a problem  lately pressing  share link  causes the app to crash  please either fix this issue and reposition  share link  lower or remove it altogether
still no notifications ugghh    please fix cannot talk to people if you do not k ow you have a message and have to click hangout for it to load or send a message to see what you received         Â  used to be a great app for my galaxy note 2 now its just blah its sad i used hangouts for phone and my chrome book   now it do not work for my phone and  only works for the chrome once in a while         please please ease fix notification and become a 5 star app again

excellent a excellent option if you are looking for a good browser which has speed and is less complicated too and solves most of the search options with built in quick links  good one mait
do not like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now  professional vibe is gone  poor facebook knockoff is here to stay  it is not just the aesthetics but the design as well  simple things  like viewing my connections or viewers  require more time  more taps  and more effort than before  others  connections are listed seemingly randomly  making it arduous to find anyone  it is worse on iphone  where speed is at a snail s pace  linkedin has lost its identity  and if it continues in this direction  it will lose its userbase too
huh  i do not get it  i put a password on it and when you go in directly it is required but accessing through my s5 s my files it is there at the bottom under cloud storage and there is no password required  how do i stop this security weakness

classic browsing at it is best    i have recently upgraded to android from a bb9900  i have been using opera on my bb for years  was actually disappointed with android at first  until i installed mini   webpages like facebook are back to the way they should be  please do not change a thing  using mini for facebook is the best  where can i donate
the authority firefox is firefox  after wandering here and there you are going to come back to this standard browser in any platform
seems to keep crashing    i am a big firefox fan but since i started using the android one here i can no longer watch or stream videos to my tablet  big disappointment indeed
wechat wallet still disappears people have been using wechat wallet in the english ios app for ages now with no problems  and yet when i put my android wechat app into english  wallet disappears  please fix the english android app so that wallet does not disappear when i change language from chinese to english  wechat wallet is incredibly useful  but only when you can actually use it
freaking awesome                                                        it has no real story line but it does not matter this was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love it it is almost better than super mario brother for crying out loud the characters are great the pig s are cute and it has my favorite bird in it hall  or green bird not going to get in to the details of why i love hall but mea  also the pigs forts are awesome  so that is why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year
fail on every update it was best app before you received messages but when you reply it will not send  video calling auto exit now even with good signal  it was very good before
why do you do this to me ok so i cannot unlock the next episode for 48 hours or i have to pay money to buy gold  so i wait and wait and 48 hours later you tell me to wait 24 more hours because i did not pay money  so here i am still waiting not going to pay you money  so how long with this take
beta is the best version of the chrome browsers cannot open bookmarks in a new tab or incognito window  cannot switch tabs from bookmarks tab  horrible features  the following are issues across all barstools of the chrome browsers  no desktop preferred option  webpages refresh themselves by default and you lose what you are typing of you switch to another app  tabs mixed into os is annoying  no user agent switcher
aa nice
hanging so much even i am using higher end mobile having 3gb ram itself pls take the needfull action and fix that error
for the build 13 0 2036 98649  new colour scheme adds nothing to the expirience  but it is the automated smart language update  with no option to select the prefered language that will be the main reason why i will uninstall this app
good but not great app is awesome  saves me a ton of memory  but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better    1  you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums  its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album  2   once pictures are in album  the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album    if you could do those 2 things    it would be
nice easy way to known about every things
the new theme is not compatible with my device     samsung galaxy j1  make it compatible please  i really love this game
rashifal ni homepagemai bhaye sun ma sugandha hune
works really well slack for android works flawlessly on my nexus 7 and is way better to use than the ios and desktop versions  the latest update has fixed a couple of the ui ux issues introduced in the previous update and glad to see the scrollbar s back when you swipe up to view the channel history
error i cannot edit my post with pictures  the moment i do  it will not change after save and it appears like when you are uploading but not yet done post in news feed and still there until i did reinstall the app  this still happens even
fun works perfectly well  ads are not as annoying as you think  especially for a free game
the worst   this newer version update might look nice  but i stopped getting all push notifications  also  the app does not even work most of the time  nothing loads and it keeps telling me to try again  it worked fine before until the most recent update  same as other apps  it just gets worse and worse  do not fix it if it is not broke
causes android device to not register touch this app has been causing issues making it so we cannot use the upper left menu of our devices  multiple people have reported this and it is caused by your app please fix this and i will rate 5 stars

very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents  otherwise great application
perfect  very close to using the desktop client
video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine will not load and will play but the screen will show grey  fix please  i do not know if others have this issue  but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this
do not use if you have a lot of organized bookmarks they recently changed bookmarks to go to the top of of your bookmarks every time you open a new tab  it used to remember what bookmark folder you were in until a recent update  i also do not like that the folders are now at the top of each bookmark list  i will be using firefox now
save image and low performance can not save an image from google image and performance google search very heavy for low devices  i miss opera classic
thank you very much for sticky notification
browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc  still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc  app does not use user input options  ignores them  again  still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozz s www  page   shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore   also they keep editing my review
unable to work with google   yahoo id sso notice that it still cannot work with google   yahoo sso which is a big feature missing   it is a good initiative  but still some work to be done before the star     still thanks for the effort
again and again    what happened to you guys     you are not listening us     again there is problem in downloading large files    and the download speed is furthermore decreased    even the phone is connected with wifi    pls fix this      3 stars for browsing speed only
it was a great game   until the last update   and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players   and let us not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish    seems like supercell only cares about wants high level trophy pushers   and they do not want people who do not cannot buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it
why cannot google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have  i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works
it is good i had typed up a longer review but then play store decided to crash    i will just say that firefox for android feels faster and more stable than the default chrome browser  also the ui is less clunky
i have used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years  but since this latest update it is become unusable on my galaxy note 10 1   links either do not work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops   bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes cannot be accessed   i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc  but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing  please sort it out mozilla
app continuously losses connection  at times i have to close app and reopen for it to reconnect  every message also takes around 10 seconds to send
new update killed the game new matching for atks basically killed the farming part of the game so you no longer can aquire resources for upgrades  get your money ready because buying your resources will be the only way
notification problems hangouts does not keep up with push notifications  to update messages i have to go into the app and manually update  been having this issue on and off for months
simple and powerfull  it is fast  small and perfectly designed for phone with low ram like my htc one  if your official facebook application always crashes and takes a lot of space on your phone  i highly recommend you this browser  the facebook feature is amazing  it is very fast and notifications pop ups  even when the browser is close  i love it
too slow loading webclips       no pdf support at all     even simpler apps do that       web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded   any program does this   geez       highlighting  needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow  no customer support responses either  evernote must have been taken over by students  it is not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell   this is especially for serious business users  any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes  this program has really retarded over the years  they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless  well they got my money this time  so i have to put up with it for a few more months  the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this
what the hell   stole all my boosters  all my boosters and power ups are gone   return it now   had more than 60 of each  what a cheap manner to manage the game   return all power ups nowww
this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out    shut down  after receiving a wechat message notification after update  my chat backgrounds were all gone blank   i cannot find my stickers as well   i have to uninstall the app   but do not know if my chat history will be here or not

hey supercell i would like you to put in a skype in the clan chats when peaple r battleing because you could help them out because you see things they do not and some type of healing defense  and thanks for the town hall 11 if you do 5 stars
did not work i looked for a movie and the app said it was no such thing as i looked up big mommas house 2
good app for call and texting  overall everything is ok  most important thing is that the battery not drained fast when you online  please add android auto support and i will rate it 5 stars
i love dropbox   but   i wish that the interface did not look so cheap  it is the only thing that is letting down a potentially stunning app  make it look as great as it is functionality and i will happily give it five stars  no qualms
sony xperia z1 very good as always  but since last update i cannot seem to be able to change the ringtone  reverts back to default

best  Â…  Â…  Â…  Â… hamro nepali keyboard is doubtlessly  the best keyboard for fluent nepali typing on android mobiles and tablets  it has given  oppurtunity to thousands of nepalese people for sharing their thoughts  expressing their feelings and chatting up with buddies through  common and national language i e  nepali  thumbs up for creating this amazing app    wish you would also add some theme customization options and improved caps lock option
why there is a delay on the messages  you will know you have messages when you open the app  it does not notify you even if you are connected to internet  wtf
often painfully slow  needs a useful tablet ui  quick reply  and the ability to send video  some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that is not really excusable from the company that runs android  this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets
it takes me two levels back and no boosters not happy with this game i passed the hard level an i was two level forward to the hard level and i had boosters after work i open the game no booster and i was two steps back  back to the hard level after that the game switches its self off
ehhh  at first i gave whatsapp 5 stars  i am now decreasing them to three  there are multiple reasons for this  1  let me send videos no matter how long they are  2  create a feature where i can make custom vibrations for different contacts  3  being completely invisible when i block someone  4  wake screen when i get a message notification  5  if i choose to mark a message as unread  it should reflect to the sender that the message is unread  6  make video chat available  7  update emojis
game glitches nice  you have all the cheesy  simple reviews right up first  hey  robin   i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstall reinstall  losing all my achievements  and it is still freezing up  it even switches to one if those annoying  30 ads in the middle of a game  is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update

i love playing candy crush but    why when you go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i do not like the waiting for the episodes      by the way good     work
not for me i thought its better than multi language keyboard but its nowhere close to it  main problem is that it does not follow the traditional nepali keyboard pattern    this may be enough for some to  post a short comment but not enough for the ones who likes to write in correct nepali
privacy at least put some option appear offline  i mean for some people like me it is a big pressure to be seen online like you need to response on every message or else you be called seenzone only  if only i want to do on facebook is to read on my newsfeed and just want to response on message i want to  pls reconsidered my review  i tried to turn off chat but still can see me as online

i think this game is such a load of rubbish it tries to con you into buying stuff from the instore app and because you do not buy anything then you can be stuck on one part of the game for ages worsed app i have ever come across
good but ui ease of use still declining i have used evernote for years and it is power is still there in its ability to find notes but its ui is still in steady decline with a lack of ease of use  needs cleaner  cleaner separation of functionality  nowadays i am having to dbl click a found note to view instead of a single click showing the note content  disappointing to see this once magnificent software reduced to the current level of ui confusion that  so many other programs exhibit as well

messenger issues ever since the last update  initial received messages do not get pushed to the messenger app and you do not get notification in the facebook app or messenger app  you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message  you have to click the icon and it opens messenger  subsequent messages go through messenger app  unless you close the chat head    then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app
good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app

this country not allowed  i would have given it 5 stars because my searches and browsing are spot on but it took me to back up account and when i put my backup e mail in it said this country not allowed  i am in america  wtf

few ui updates 1  group should be included with group status    so that if common event is there then the event can be posted through group status   and group name need not be changed      as it becomes difficult to identify a particular group if a particular festival is there and all group name seems to be similar          2  profile picture and profile status should be at one place not seperate    for status we have shortcut but for profile picture we have to go into settings then profile then comes profile picture

ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews  there are ads after every round  whether you pass it or fail it  sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to  you spend more time on ads than game play  i develop web apps  and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living  i can appreciate that all to well  however  these developers have went far beyond that  frankly  they are disrespectful nitwits

absurdly large file for an android browser and after lollipop upgrade i no longer have the space available for updates  would gladly uninstall if i could  over 40 megs for an android browser
shite  crashes constantly  test 1st does nothing a browser should  obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release       i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing    bonus   crashing the operating system
new menu sucks for power users

great code but arrogant company linkedin should be proper stewards of the database they have created  and ensure their customers get optimum use  too many gotchas  no cut and paste from messages  closed api s  etc  pretty narrow minded
unstable  freezes and crashes customisatins and capabilities are unmatched  but seems to freeze way too much atm  some video s will not play that do on other browsers  cannot even arrange bookmarks  looking at other browsers now
when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top  the only social app that does that  such a headache
after observation of all above things v should be hated all that which is outof humanity  n moral ways of  loves on nature s beauty sweety n every mracles  l were created by allahsubhanahutallah  hence v  loves all morally behave  with everyone for deen duniyan n aakhirat for suxess  for all  that  v will get that output  only    for what v  invested input  for the same
decent  but getting worse with each update  was my undisputed go to app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now  getting buggier with each update  crashes frequently  especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously  unresponsive for a few heavy websites  still hoping the devs at google fix this because i am still a huge chrome fan and going to continue using it
add    search people if you do not have the persons number   but they have whatsapp you should be able to search their name and then   add them or something   then it would be 5 stars
google messenger and hangouts should become one google messenger and hangouts should become one app that works like imessages except android  if it detects they are using hangouts google messenger it will send a message in the form of hangouts  which will show up in the conjoined app  but if it does not detect them using hangouts google messenger then it will simply send a sms message instead
account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying cannot create an account at this time
its not safe it has a link to gallery and file manager also   so anone can easily get access to my private photos without any password or restriction

cannot get off first base  having give problems synchronizing with the web version   keeps asking for login password and never goes further   reinstalling for last time before i give up

easy to play and always running  jumping and defy gravity  it   s a real competition how far can you survive  wonderful game
i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it  i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones

great app   good tool for my arsenal  it is like a virtual notebook or binder or file cabinet for me  and its wonderful   i use different apps for quick notes and tasks  i would use it for tasks if it had repeating reminders   ability to snooze them  then also sync w google calendar   but if i need to save long term notes  or receipts  or travel plans  prayers   spiritual writings  how tos  etc   evernote is the app for that   easy to use  never loses my notes  it is dependable and reliable   i love using the desktop version also
voice massage do not work i cannot send  voice message to any of my friend  my phone s mic is good but in messenger it not working  tell me why it is not working

new update sucks no more dead bases  farming is now impossible unless you buy gems to boost barracks or buy loot  used to play a few hours a day now if i play once a week its a lot
simply good but    i think loss of reply option keeps people away from this app because  especially  in the groups  it is necessary to show whom your chatting with
awesome
new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them   submitting issues does not seem to work in the mobile app  the submit button is never enabled  this last update was a loser
i love viber viber is an excellent chatting software  only one tiny negative comment for you  sometimes it takes a delay to reach message even online   stickers are so cool
changeable it really change our way of getting news
great app minus the spam  best note taking app  honestly  this app does everything you could possibly need it to  keywords make searching for notes so easy   however    please stop pushing me so hard into paying for premium plans  i do not need nor do i want them  obviously if i am dismissing the ad every time i use the app i must not be interested  stop spamming me  edit  why are you still spamming me  please please stop  no does not mean keep asking
bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now  this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet  please take a look at it and send a reply or update   handset   note 5   hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again
great hamro patro
it was epic    then a certain update happened the most recent update got rid of what a ton of people loved  i think supercell has some work to do if they think i am going to be buying any more gems
good game but    i have always liked temple run however the new update which included a new map has ruined it for me a little bit   i would of rather of it been snowy on the default map since since for me anyway the new map is a bit confusing and can be harder
firefox is getting better     slowly it crashes regularly  it does not play video on youtube  otherwise it is a promising fast browser  i still miss the gestures swipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks  see ucbrowser hd
j khojyo thyehi paine ek matra apps

cannot connect right now when trying to open links in the facebook browser  i receive a cannot connect right now error message  other items on my news feed continue to load
when you repeat over and over that you support animated gifs now  maybe a good idea would be to actually support them
contacts name and pic i want to know why alot of my new contacts just do not appear only appears if they are online or not and their pic and status do not     can this problem be solved
not able to see recently connected people hi i am not able to see the recently connected people in the notification tab from where i can see the people with whom i connected recently

govinda gautam apps is good having facillity of typing  both nepali and english fonts directly  but i could not type the half nepali font
like button the like button  you know the thing that you can actually change now with a sticker ie snowman  after the update it has never worked on me  i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing it still do not work
gone crazy after latest updates  it seems to force closed by itself even if i do not use it  always popup a error message almost everyday  it seems to trigger whenever i switch between mobile data and wifi connection
issues with address book contacts i have turned off the feature to update my android contacts based on linkedin information  but it still keeps updating with unwanted title on my address book  i have uninstalled the app n reinstalled it  cleared the data for the app but made no difference  i am using galaxy s6 and would really appreciate if anyone can solve this issue  the best option seems to uninstall the app for good and use just the broswer
just one irritating issue very nice app    except one issue      there is no option of select all for photos inside a folder  i have to select each photo individually  and there is no option to download or make offline the entire folder  one of the above options must be there
connection issues app always says cannot refresh now  try later which in particular has to do with the net  but my wifi works well enough  i can even play online games  i can refresh my feed at ig and twitter so why cannot i refresh my fb feed  fix it please
viber about the voice messages and chatting  viber is the best app in the market  about the calling services   even messenger performs better  the app is not optimised for wi fi usage  about the newest version  until 23 12 2015  there is a new option introduced  which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat  well  it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad   finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly
fantastic and helpful i find this app so helpful  i have the paid version  would not really want the free version  as i love being able to take photos of business cards and turn them into contacts  it also has the ability to find text within pdfs  which is also extremely useful
inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible  1  it crashes constantly  2  scrolling is very jerky  3  on screen rotation the window does not resize  4  there is no word wrap when answering certain forums  5  downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone  6  pages are very slow to load  both the pre installed samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox  pity
it is brilliant  take a photo on my phone and within a minute it is on my pc at home  file  same  make a change on a file on my phone and its changed on the file at home   this app makes the above so easy  no issues  crashes or problems      just great
connection issues everytime i try and click on a link or profile i keep getting can not refresh  it does this whether its on wifi   lte  4g so i am finding myself having to continuously close app from multitasking and re load it periodically
profile any time my wife or anybody has more than one post and i view them it would take me to there profile so that i can view them all at once  now when i try to view them it tells me that the page that i requested is not available  i have restarted my phone i even cleard the cache and i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is still doing it  please fix it thank you

so much room for improvement    the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still has not lived up to its full potential  here is an example  how do not we have the capability to save gifs and videos  not only that  but it would be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances  simple updates like those would make this app so much better  not lame ones like changing favorites to likes  hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016
fix this please    i have tried editing two of my profile pictures in the past month and each time i do   it does not post it  but it also does not go away  it fades out the picture and it is always at the top of my time line  now i have one from december 14th  and the second one from tonight at the top of my time line and it will not let me delete them  or do anything about it  and it is really buggin  me  please fix this
too many ads far more adverts than any other game i have played  i know it is free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance
cannot hook up credit card to wallet unable to connect american express credit card to wallet  get the message system is busy  please try again later      also  why cannot we post just at text post to our moments
it is great when it works but right now it will not download any mms  it just says they are there and will not download them  and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead
great best cross platform cloud storage and has some awesome functionality  it is without a doubt the best cloud storage out there
connection issues with the version it says cannot connect to server    with error report 1  1  everytime either connected with cellular data connection or over wifi
great  perfect  no complaints
very good apps                                                                                          ios  operating  system
does not work challenge page fails to load  it is so secure even i cannot get in
it is useful a great app and pretty much an essential part of my organization  a minor complaint is that the desktop program does not look as appealing as the mobile app  and that the mobile version is lacking some useful functions  e g  the ability to delete tags  or to strikethrough text
it is notification system is so poor  it does not notify me when any message arrives  no it is too slow to chat also
unable to change alert sound  not in options   unable to enable alerts per channel  on all or keywords and direct    closer to a beta than an app
improve    please add a feature where we can see online contacts only we are tired of searching contact and knowing that whether it is online or not   thanks
great application  but the premium notifications have become too invasive  leading to unpleasant clutter  alternative options are becoming much more attractive due to this
book and their use as a great christmas navarro was going to get a lot of different names for christmas is a screamer and i cannot remember if my sis and baking and making everything so perfect for me to believe in things and i will return to go over in a few minutes ago and i have a great day at home soon and their little room in the kids to school with your questions
great and solid app  love the widget  most important feature about this app in my opinion  couple things  number and bullet point lists do not show as formatted when seen on the widget  please fix  also  i would personally like it if emojis were implemented  i would also like it if we had more control over the appearance of the widget  opacity  font size color  background color
great app but    i heard that apple added some amazing emojis but i have been complaining about not seeing some emojis my iphone friend users send and it bothers me  so can you just add those new emojis please  thank you
what has happened  it does not give me my messages on time and people can not hear me on outcalls at all  please fix other wise i would give it 5 stars
viber rating   lacking code on the android phone  the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen  it is not able to be moved and i cannot find the setting to turn it off  might want to fix it  also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call
edit  gif support  yay  if this can be addressed this app will get 5 stars    having to manually resend messages is a bummer  terrible while traveling with spotty net
i wish there is a mute button for selected people  i like it so far but it is more like a skype now  but i hope next update the will be option like mute button where i can mute someone so that i will not recieve any notification from that particular person without deleting the message or blocking them coz that would be so rude if i do that  or option where i can hide the seen or a mark as unread  other than that it is good i liked it  that is all my concern
following back it does not let me follow people that have followed me back   and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect     overall it is a live appp
excellent
linda cooper hardy it is essential at times  to communicate one person to another   not open to all to read or know   i like that aspect of the messenger field  sometimes on facebook i wish i could have a one to another conversation about   whatever   i find it necessary to discuss more personal subjects that may start on facebook  then end up on messenger   like a phone with no party lines  i would enjoy a privacy option   for now  we have messenger
almost  but not quite  this has so much potential  but i really would like a back function that works  i press back and wait  nothing happens  i press back again and it takes me to the homepage   same for the back button on the tablet   i am using a 1st gen nexus 7
neat idea  but let down by no linux support  an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it  and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service    which is where evernote fails   it is not natively available for linux based operating systems  such as ubuntu   sure  the android application works well enough   but when the only way to access evernote under a linux based operating system is via a web browser  it quickly looses its appeal
would give 5  if i could retrieve my previous game my phone crashed and i had to install it again  did not get to keep my score  coins and boosts  the gems i paid for where also lost  negatives aside  i enjoy this game  its a good time waster  i thinks it is better than the first temple run
love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space  you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life
outstanding this app is not only fabulous on android platform but also popular  this is the first app which can be useful for all people
possible solution to trounle entering site i like this ap    one reviewer says he could not get in after installing it   at installation i was asked if i wanted to go through google  or facebook  i think    i choose google   now when i call it up  there is a link to sign up here   if i press click on that link  it opens my todo page   try that
works but very basic  needs more  works fine  needs interface update  how about thumbnail icon views  or a small list  for instance  photos need a timeline  or even a  gasp  metadata exif tag search  how about embedding carousel functionality  and adding to it  google photos is far from perfect  but does have good ideas
awesome game but    this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level there is another add but even with all the adds it is still an amazing game
once a great game i was a hardcore fan of this game  but you got to admit    the latest update sucks    its impossible for farming    if you want to make some loot  you going to have to go gowipe or something  it takes a minimum of 1 hour without boost  to make troops  and that sucks    plz fix this as soon as possible before i with many others move on

really great  twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day  i do have problems with it though   this is personal preference  whenever i refresh the page  it gives me a tweet with the subtext  twitter name  follows  twitter name  and it happens every time i refresh  so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets  othe than that its fine
does not refresh properly i added a few contacts but they do not show up on whatsapp   i hit the refresh button  but no luck
it used up my battery       i forgot to switch back to my home screen and keep opening dropbox app  then my battery dropped from 50  to 25  in 30mins  it really is a  drop box
messed my phones default screenshot setting up i installed and everything was great until i noticed when i held down power plus home  which used to take a screen shot  now my phone wants to do a firefox search with this command  after calling samsung there is no way to fix this short of a factory reset and losing all my data  thanks firefox
nice app i suggest you to add a word count feature and font size  i think it is essential feature for a note app  but  well  keep the good things up  you have done a really amazing job  thanks
way to ruin it  this game was good at one point   i supported this game with real money   if you cannot say anything nice  i hope other people can find a good time playing this

every company should use slack i do not usually give 5 stars  but man  slack is great for group company communication  in the office  at home  and on the go  takes a bit of getting used to but is well worth it

classic game ruined by ads  uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads  installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet  wondered why he kept crying and complaining  realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level  ridiculous

even though i am loving the new update  but this breaks the default contacts app on the note 5  under accounts linkedin sync has no account header name and that breaks editing of contacts   update  opened a ticket with linkedin support and they agreed that the contacts app break on merged contacts is a bug  this is with their engineering team to be fixed  update2   contacts force close exists as off version 4 0 11  update3   finally the contacts bug has been fixed

terrible worst app ever 45 mins trying to back up photos  will not drag and drop from pc or mobile  will only let you highlight 1 at a time  what fool designed this to be easy  maybe it does but its not clear onedrive app so much better and simple  all you want is it to run in background but its a joke
booster should be internet independent why internet connection required to get daily spin  it should be  part of game itself  every time i have open net connection to get daily spin  unacceptable
can you say ads every time i open a tweet there is an ad sitting at the bottom  they appear ridiculously frequently throughout my feed  i get that developers are trying to make a living but come on this is so excessive

installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop  your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you cannot go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list   and did i mention it is crap
update does not address facebook issue sadly you all seem not to care that your game is now limited by mandatory facebook connection that does not work  deleting now

not since the update i do not                                   update   it is very slow on both data  uk ee network  and wifi  all of home via bt  work network london underground virgin network  on all devices  version number is 13 0 2036 98649 on each device   practically unusable at present and everything was fine before upgrading   reading other comments i am far from the only one having problems  high and low quality images helps but it is still worse than before the upgrade   and just discovered that previously a double tap enlarged the text sufficiently to make it readable   now it enlarges it a tiny amount but pinch and zoom is still required     why did you do this   the good old adage  if it are not broke do not fix it absolutely comes to mind
nyc  1 you guys should apply some same strategy as you applied in boom beach  when we use the troops  the remaining undead troops should return to their base  but instead of that  they r dead  fix this for remaining 2 star frm me
some issues i love this app but i have been having some issues lately  it has started telling me that hangouts is no longer supported by google play  you can not send a video  and when on a video chat it seems to lag really bad  wish we had something like imessage in our regular text and facetime
great game i have enjoyed playing ever since i downloaded it this summer  i like it much more than the first one   the challenges and visuals are improved as well as the way you run through the game  highly recommend
gave you too many chances i love desktop firefox  this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome  i have installed it about 5 times thinking hoping it would get better  there are much better browsers for android than this eg  dolphin or maxthon
bookmarks the option to open a bookmark in a new tab is taken away  i use that feature and would like it back  also  now the keyboard opens automatically  which i often do not want and have to close it

unbelievably bad support by google for their own products   had to hard reset my android 4 04 tablet and could not reinstall chrome because google no longer supports chrome browser on android 4 0x   so i had to install a non google browser  i would give a rating of 0 if i could
facebook ripoff used to see my connections new connections in news feed  now all i see is silly opinion posts   no longer a networking site at all
so fun  i am totally addicted to this game  i play it way too much because it is so fun and has really smooth game play
too many recent glitches i used to play this all the time  i am level 500  but now cannot even log into the game  it started removing received boosters n not recording passed levels so they would have to b replayed  now it tries to load for 5 8 mins then just kicks me off  have not been able to play for weeks now  will b uninstalling soon if not fixed  really disappointed with candy crush now
still not cool guys please  this is still not cool after all those updates  i have got a lot of ram but it keeps reloading pages that i have left open for later viewing  the old one could do that  it could keep pages for weeks  guys  seriously   opera please

very reliable syncing but      the web ui looks like it is been designed by a college kid with a laptop no grid view 2gb free space in 2016 wah photos look ridiculous on  list view the android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable feature too plain and oversimplified ui no download option directly to sd card
great  keep it up  i have been using uc mini for quiet a while and i have to say that you guys have done a great job  i have a 2g phone with low storage so it was hard for me to use youtube but you guys made my problem go away great job keep it up
this used to be my favorite app    this was the only app that i used for messaging for quite a while  that was all the way up until the notifications stopped working  this has been a major annoyance and has proved to be extremely problematic as well  i love everything about this app apart from the fact that it does not notify me when i get a message  since this is a google application you would think that a bug so simple would be gotten rid of  but i must say  i am quite disappointed with the google team
cannot install  error code   505  have samsung galaxy note edge  had issues and could not update so i uninstalled the app and now i cannot reinstall it  total bs
good ui ux and helpful in governance looking the fact that indian government specially indian railway and its officials are using twitter app rigorously for assistance and services   i am installing it  twitter is changing the way of governance in world s biggest democracy india  team twitter should also look to make twitter better and friendly for governance point of view  if any possibility persists for same

best apps        apps use                                                                     Â…    computer
some notification problem although i have enabled notification Â  i am not being able to get notification only from ekantipur on my htc desire 826 and it is slower than in other inferior devices  i want to know if this problem is only with me or ekantipur is working on this kind of device  notification feature is very useful for a busy person like me who does not get much time to sit back and read news  notifications enables to take a quick look at headlines and understand the situation and can read the selected news according to choice
fix some things one letter is capitalized and it goes back again to lowercase  emoji donot appear when i send them box appears but not emotions and include more emoji
newest version does not receive push notifications had to revert to original hangouts app until this is fixed
rocking this app is the best among all the news apps
regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function  in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu  the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about 40mb starting up   the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory  however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted  i love uc but i am sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs  it is probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however
download issues using asus zenfon 5 and several times does not let me download anything  shows the text downloading  but does not  please fix the issue  otherwise pretty smooth
frequently resets once again  it has reset and taken all stored boosters  this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other  i do not understand why that information is not stored  since things like your level and gold are retained
excellent reception amazing app that let us you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills
keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install add ons and plug ins is amazing  but it keeps crashing on me all the time  i will be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page will not scroll for me  i will try and zoom in and the font will not rerender  and i cannot click on anything  however  the ui still functions normally  but i cannot get anything to work on the webpages  if that could somehow be fixed  it would ramp ya back up to 5 stars
hamro keyboar needs update n new emojis thnkz fo awsome apps        plz update  keyboard
the fail boat has arrived the 6 0 version is touted as being advanced  but in fact it contains a big old disappointment  the widget  which was not even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts   is now no longer available  wth   fail  why do i want to use an sms app  or any messaging app  which cannot even give me a quick review widget on my home screen   pffft   rolled back to 4 2 apk  and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets  one   person specific
good as far as i have it fast and reliable  for now  only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faast  but that is mayth be due some option in phone maybee
memory game the levels are so hard and less moves   l do no how to pass 95 levels but levels are so bour  chico bar is very hard to finish  please any of you send me life
down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015  then one of these useless all new  redesigns was perpetrated   now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound  silent  vibrate  etc   are nowhere to be found   had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet  that is unforgivably incompetent   i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout  as many other reviewers do    boo   from 4 stars to 1
very useful
video capture for moment where did video moment go  i want to capture video but i cannot find it where to capture video  when i slide downwards nothing came out  is it bcuz the new updates there is no video for new updates  fix this problem pleasee
1 star new update i am a busy man and do not always have hours to play games  coc let me pick when i had time to play  after the update that is no longer true  now i have to get on every few hours and raid for hours and hours just to level 1 building  they made the game for the 1  hardcore players  not the average player
fonts why in the heck is this thing analysing my fonts    not really quick browsing when i have to wait 5minutes for the fonts to load  are you asking my opinion  avoid this  terrible
please fix error new version p8 lite  user i cannot open my viber    when i open it  automatically close i cannot log in see the contacts and my messages pls fix
it was good untill i upgrade overall opera mini is good  the page loads faster and saves time  but most of the time eventhough i have a good network connection  it will show that there is no network connection  then   when i upgrade to this version   the network speed after this update is really so fast    when i tried to download a song   eventhough i have 3g connection it downloads at a rate of 4 7 kb sec   it took 20 mins to download a 6mb song in a 3g connection  i am really frustrated with this    so i am going to uninstall it
old is best old version  is better then this version
loved it i loooooooooooooovvved it because it is incredible  awesome  and it is in go power and make a new clash of clans the same thing  butt better
i have had to uninstall this app twice this week because whenever i try to edit a post  the post does not edit and just stays gray and stuck in the loading process forever  my o c d  cannot handle that
surprised been atleast 3 years since i switched to chrome on pc  it was by chance and some luck that i stumbled upon firefox for android  i am absolutely hooked   proper tabbed browsing helps me keep my jungle of open app state screenshots a lot simpler  my favorite feature would be queing new links from other apps to be opened later  neato    made me install firefox again on all my other devices after a long time    good going mozilla
keeps crashing ever since i started using it more  it will crash every ten minutes  its starting to get more annoying  however it is convenient for saving text messages since i do not have unlimited messaging

viber i think so she is going to you guys you know figure out free for the rings sometimes i forget to ring in all forget to the shop  the message of this one now i will let you know no i hope you figure out later so that is my paper right
fully ads based even in data connection  and loads pretty badly   i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app  why kantipur network required ads based activities in this app  google advertisement must not be used while using data  and what a load while using this app  kmg app was better than this  i suggest you to look annapurna post beta app    while using from data  first loading the advertisement and after that loading news   what a bullshit coding  fix this for 5 star
great game  really dislike the ads  i usually do not  write reviews  but this time i am because it is getting  ridiculous  every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying  i know the ads help with money but  at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up  and force s you to watch it
app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android  usually great app but stops working a random times     very annoying       have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now       may need to find another app
1 great game  challenging to the point where you do not want to give it up  great thing while you are bored  waiting or just want to play  cannot stop playing  great job rovio
excellent as long as you have good service  it works great  use it to talk to my family in chile and asia   it cuts out if you do not have wifi or excellent service
update few things     uc mini is very speed for dwnldng and other things  and plz provide an option for online videos dwnldng and youtube dwnldng  i hope iam expecting this feature from you as soon as
need some improvements hey guys  i personally love this app as it is too easy to type in nepali as it automatically unicodes but you need to add some more features    this app does not include capslock  theme customization   it is really hard to type in big screen tablets phones coz it is size relatively small  so please in next update include the features mentoined above    then it will worth                            thanks
auto capitalization needed  it does not automatically capitalize the first letter of sentense in english keyboard  its an essential feature  please fix it
widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a note taker  i access it primarily through its widget  the old widget was great  giving a peek at a few recent notes  then that widget was killed off  and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes  with maybe just part of the title of a third note  and no content at all  it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason  also  there is no undo button
nice apps
nice game     its simply amazing   but i would like it better if we had custom options for graphics  it runs extremely smooth but the developer should go easy on the memory that is  it takes more space now than ever before  but overall its an epic game
so disappointed my candy crush would not connect to fb so i uninstalled and reinstalled  still did not work so i restarted my phone  that worked only i am two levels back and all my power ups are gone
works great  i wish it supported expandable   collapsible hierarchies though
nice browser but   there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile  great options to customize the browser to suit your needs  however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites  i hope the speed improves in newer versions and i will add a 5 star rating
install and reinstall the app but cannot go back to the previous version   pls new version is so annoying  no more options for the contacts to set up if just want viber contacts only to appear  all contacts were shown even not using viber  pls fix
erroneous app    the wechat app is not loading my location data and therefore i am not able to find people nearby  the previous version used to work fine in my droid but the new version is irritating me a lot  now  this app is of no use if i cannot explore new friends in my locality
slow  with weird lack of features    really slow  not sure why  has good search bar  but no way to add search engines  cannot download images from google search  no problem  downloading from bing  it seems there are good feature spread between this and opera mobile  combined they would make a good browser  but independently they are not good enough
very smooth i would say it is much better than just uc browser which loads pages as if you are on your laptop with a really bad server  love everything about it
ugly design  no autoimport from old install  iphone ui design in the android app   come on   one day it suddenly would not start   just showed globe and quit  nothing similar has happened with alternative apps  on top of that when i reinstalled it ignored the user folder so even though pics  and supposedly chat  is in there wechat did not read the folder so it is all empty in chats inside wechat after a reinstall  awful
translation use it for browsing and visiting viet and chinese and other country sites for translations  but using uc browser for downloading   no other app can replace uc for fast downloading speed
want to know why did the other people i can see only 10 post and i cannot like or comment their post   is that mean their unfriend me or something wrong with that
what is app is not in it is format in my mobile massages are sending through left side and all the layout of what is app is starting from left while in my old mobile all is in right side  i feel so much trouble due to this
please add this option i love using hangouts for both i am and sms but when sending a photo from the share menu the app defaults to my sms plan thus costing me money  if i try to go back the hangouts app quits  leaving me with no way to choose of i want to send a picture via mms sms or hangouts  i am   its costing me a small fortune  the option to choose how which messaging service you want to use when sharing a photo would be great
yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choice very important some of the people making choices for us are not well   the i thought tony bennet   the good life    to be sussinct
low quality i do not know why but sound is very bad  especially when i talk  i use meizu m2 mini and is not slow phone at all  is there some update or setup whitch can fix it  i will rate 5 stars if there is a fix

ok for the simple stuff  feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging it is fine  but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips  can be a bit slow to load conversations  overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy  simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner    which is obviously not ideal for every other action  especially since it uses google auth services
want to get all 5 stars       reduce the amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings instead of days put it hours i e town hall level 6 takes 4 days put it four hours i never saw a game that goes more than 4 days to upgrade something  each month i will remove 1 star if you do not fix it
needed to learn the hard way about town hall penalty if you attack an opponent with 1 level lower town hall you get 50  of loot  2 levels 25  and it decreases hence forth   i am a newbie no where in the tutorial its mentioned
only miss cache to be bought
awesome its nice but not compatible with my handset gionee p2s if you can make it compatible i would be happy but do not woory i have i phone in march 2016 then i will play till then wish you all happy new year and hats off to this game
major flaws constant updates and always getting not installed messages   i can use it for awhile and then it is no longer installed   none of my other apps do this
unable to send message or update this new version does not allows sending messages nor does it updates the status  it keeps suggesting to come back  linkedin what happened  your app was one of the best
will not load everytime i try to use facebook  well lately  it says trouble loading in every aspect  it is been doing this for 2 days i have tried restarting my phone  closing the app  it does not work
works great maybe you could do something about the download location  i cannot change it to external storage  i do not want the downloads to fill up the phone memory  please do something about that
still no widget  come on  i used to use this for all of my sms  not anymore  unacceptable   instead of adding a new welcome screen with latest update  they should have brought back the widget
what is new  broken  differently  again   too bad google is such a small company it does not have the resources to create a good product  the latest update has now made the camera go almost black and the speaker has stopped functioning  i have to hold the phone up to my ear to hear the other person
are you serious  there is no widget available
why we have to use this  google we think its a time to make some changes in your team  who is planning and making this horrible aps  is apple or microsoft paying you for that   what is about dark theme for the beginning for this useless app   and make ability for sending files pls  make everything in one place  we do not need dozen usless aps
i cannot get back on facebook it is my email that is wrong or my password  no matter what i do it just sucks because  i really want to talk to my grandchildren  that is the only way i can see or hear from them most of the time
slick chat app  reactions are my favorite part of using slack  i love adding my own
sort option not working they have just provided options for sort  new to older  but it never works
no upgrades to the game till yet   the developers have no idea how to do upgrades     most of the people have stopped playing it because it got old and there is no fun playing it now
notification so much update in a every week  but notification still suck  it stuck when app destroyed by system and will not appear when app started  why
fun but hard angry birds is really fun video game that people from at least 6 year olds and people that are a lot  a lot  a lot of years older than that  just one thing  it is really  really hard  but a challenge can teach children how to control their tempers  even though it can ba a little frustrating
does not work every time i try to sign up it says could not processes registration  it did the same thing on my android tablet and my doogee x5 cell phone  please fix and i will rate 5 stars
please do not stop carousel   google has improved their gallery app  google photo  to make google drive better for photo backup  cannot only store photos  but also create interesting effects  animations and story for users  and even  unlimited space  however  meanwhile  you decided to give up carousel  i am a royal user of dropbox  but do not you know that photo backup is one of the most important things while one chooses an online storage tool  wish this will not be the turning point that dropbox is beaten by google drive
cannot cast to chromecast of all the apps that chromecast supports  chrome browser is not supported  why  how am i supposed to cast my browser  use firefox  or worse wait for ie  fix it already chrome  come on
keeps updating updates all the time  slows my phone as it is doing it to a crawl  installs for like 3 minutes  and the updates never produce anything different or anything of use  the only app on my phone that i have issues with
bugs with contact syncing very frustrated  after having this app work fine for a couple years  i get an update that screwed up my contacts  i have read others  comments and the supposed solutions  including uninstalling and reinstalling the app  for a brief few hours last night  it appeared to re sync my linkedin contacts back to my phone contacts  today  gone again  in any case  even when the contacts came back  all my previously set up shortcuts to those contacts were disabled  can you fix this linkedin  i use a samsung galaxy 3s
whenever i post an update and then try to edit it when i hit save it tells me the post is no longer available and may have been removed yet the original post is still on my page   please fix issue
i love hamro keybord
confusing i used the app to import important notes from another smartphone note book to my current phone  although it transferred the information  it is so hard to find it    it disappeared completely
this is it  so  this is going to be the list of things you need to improve for constant five stars   include more emojis   the ones you provided do not even express enough feelings of a dog    provide instructions somewhere because people have uninstalled this app because they were more confused than they were thankful to you guys   when i capitalize english letterd  only one letter is capitalized and it goes back to lowercase  fix this   you guys are awesome i love this app   no more bugs keep up the great work
was great  broken with marshmallow i lauded evernote for working across more devices and os than other products  but dropping stars as with android 6  if you format sdcard as internal  required to effectively use sdcard for apps and games   evernote will not run  it asks for a  memory card
slow update  slow  firefox just keeps on getting better with each update   so far it is the only one that supports flash w o force close that i have used on 4 4 kitkat   keep up the great work guys
worst app ever seen  one of the worst app i have ever seen  it takes more then 2 minutes to open   my htc m8 frequently gets lag while running this app  app developer  just look times of india app   try to improve your kmg app 2  for now  i suggest everyone  do not
unsatisfactory version older version was more user friendly than this one  i cannot see my rank among my connection and colleagues  this is really bad  i wish to revert back to old version
fast on slow phones this seems to be the fastest browser i have been able to find for slow phones  its works great on my ancient samsung  and nothing usually works great on this old phone lol
smh linkedin will not allow me to send connection request through android  but on the other hand i am able to send connection request via ipad  hello    please fix   the new set up is fancy but horrible
wtf keeps going offline automatically  my messages never comes through until i open da app
it was good but the last update caused so many forced close  it was good but the last update caused so many forced close  now i cannot really enjoy my browsing experience  thanks for nothing
better background playback and  new tab  position firefox is the best looking browser on android if i do say so myself  what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background  since i use youtube as ambience a lot  and the  new tab  button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier
cannot download pics i used to be able to download pics from a conversation and save them to my phone  i do not have that option anymore  long press gives me about every other option but not the option to download
the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly       if you have ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytime all the time using powerful searches  then evernote is for you  take a picture of anything and store it  scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note  forward emails directly into evernote  drag and drop computer files  create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode  clip pages or parts of web pages  use voice
excellent my entire team would be lost without this  works with web app exceptionally well too
light  fast  and comfortable apps when i compare 3 different browser  watch speed connection  ram and cpu usage then i know opera and their products is very good for smartphone and pcs
nice for the size  it is great   nice ui   small footprint  complain   you belong in scroogle s camp
nice so far  i have been using firefox on my pc for the longest time and love it  and it is no different from the android version  there are a few things i wish were a bit different but all in all i am happy with it
bad bad google why was i sent to password recovery options when updating a browser app    5 stars   is it time to go to an apple or windows phone platform america
looks great  works well and supports ubuntu  but needs removable storage support  an application like this is only as good as the service behind it  and this is where dropbox excels   it works flawlessly  securely and even has a native client available for linux based operating systems  ubuntu and steamos   my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage  such as micro sdxc memory cards   for which a star is lost
lack of options and closed code so many options for years not implemented and now whatsapp is simply copy pasting the features telegram creates  moved to telegram which is whatsapp but on steroids which even offers desktop integration so you can use it on the pc and more
great internal comms system for our business
ads problem
camera option is horrible you cannot crop the image sideways    it has to be perfect square or rectangle   camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images  and it needs notebooks within notebooks  the camera flash always on  and when you do needs it  it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture  the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document  editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch
messenger facebook integration issue ever since the last update  initial received messages do not get pushed to the messenger app and you do not get notification in the facebook app or messenger app  you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message  you have to click the icon and it opens messenger  subsequent messages go through messenger app  unless you close the chat head    then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app
always entertaining we all know angry birds by now  definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time  the only thing that i do not like about it are the advertisements when i am playing with my wifi of data turned on  they can be a bit disruptive during game play
fantastic love it this is the best browser on the market i v tried most of the others and they do not come close keep up the good work
it rocks this thing is  great  i keep documents  photos  everything  accessible on all my devices current  very slick
good but not the better i cannot see the videos sometimes  the notifications are bad and always the app is not responding  this actually is the worst update  please check it
does not work whatsapp messages were not sending at all  it was not a connection problem  i checked  so i tried reinstalling and it will not even let me set up my account now    they ask for my phone number and it keeps trying to connect and fails  again  not a connection problem  what do i do
not bad i like to every news bt i cannot get found new update please update hour by hours
awesome browser really easy to use  and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension  to get rid off annoying ads  love it
its nice     accecesible where mobile mobie data is or wi fi if accesible so that if are are in in trouble of any sor anyttime we can immediatetely tweet which reaches to near n dear ones   other thousands of ther too on the web         helpful in many ways
causes a lot of battery drainage so i love firefox both on pc and android but i have noticed recently that firefox has been draining a lot of my battery  before this was never an issue  firefox always ran smoothly but now certain webpages with glitch out  jump back up to the top of the page on random  or just not load completely  i have checked my wi fi and data so that is not the issue  it seems like the app is working harder than it needs to and it always makes my phone very hot
awesome aafnaii vasa ma lekhna paauda khusii lagyoo    eaataii aaru aaps haru pani nikaldaii gaarnuu hoola
no pin lock security this new version is missing the security feature of being able to lock out access with a pin
new update sucks  no more dead bases  no more farming  you are almost often match with the same th level or higher  new shield system sucks too
voice messages problem most times recorded message do not be delivered completely    it is always missing a big part of it  i noticed that this happens when ever the cellular network is unstable    how ever it is a big disadvantage of the app   hope you fix it so so i can give the app 5
it is really nice app   i love this app
love hate has bug and security issues  i tried to report that facebook and google plus have security issues and it would not allow me to do so  well i just did did not i
would rate 5 but since the new update every time i try to play the new world get kicked out of game
good
better user interface  worse quality the user interface is definitely better now but at the same time there is a bug concerning synchronising the contacts with the phone contacts  and even when that bug got fixed the contact photo does not get shown any more in contrary to previous releases
i used to play this game almost 5 years ago and it was my absolute favorite  i recently re installed it and i got to say  it is very slow and this will be the third time in less than a month that i have lost my boosters     i have paid for them and it gets taken out of my account but i still do not have them   i really love this game  please fix the app because it is such a great game  get with the program guys  it is just so slow  besides that we love this game
the best android browser fast  well designed  easy tab management  i was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and it is done  great
makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed   i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts   plus you can save screenshots  websites  pictures   anything   and they are searchable
please include membership when viewing lists  i am on samsung android  and i do not know if this applies with android users in general  but this app version does not seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists  it is available on web browser though  please consider including members of list option in the app
does not seem to work at all  no widget and does not sync with site
still rubbish  still cannot log in  fb inspired interface is completely unprofessional  cannot log into the app with my password  works on the website  not on the app  takes me back and forth from the login screen to verification and back  the facebook inspired interface is just too unprofessional
cannot use properly                                                            let me edit the review after using this keyboard for a week  i am sorry but this keyboard is almost unusable  does not pick the right word  very very user  unfriendly interface  pls make it usable many thanks and hope it will get better so that i can reinstall it back again
good this is a great game  good challenges too  something you can just easily wip out when you are bored  keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment
almost every time i scroll on a webpage  the copy dialog appears at the top of the page  also i do not care for the new tab opened switch  popup that appears on the screen when i open another tab  i think that should be in the opera mini settings menu
what happened to you opera    the resent updation make the browser more beautiful to look  than the previous versions  but the smoothness of the browser is gone   yes it have some unique properties whwn compared to other browser such as data saving mode re open closed tab etc   but the problem which i face is that   1  the web pages are not fit to my screen  ie the all the web pages opend through this browser is shows only3 4 part of my screen    2  annoying ads on the home screen of the browser    3  private browsing is not working
downloading files in background i started a song download but it failed   then after 2 minutes it automatically downloaded 2 copies of the song in background
constantly erases text i have frequently lost messages i have been typing  sometimes very long ones  when the screen changes orientation  if i tip my screen even a little and messenger shift the orientation it instantly erases everything i have written
slowly becoming less and less functional functionality within app seems to be diminishing   hangouts does not automatically compress files being sent via mms which results in many of them bouncing back  muted conversations still ring if a new message is received in a non muted thread  if this is google s way of forcing people to messenger its going to force me off both and i will use third party apps
seriously needs usability updates  app is ok but storage jumps from free to  10 mo after downloading files dropbox asks to upload it  great  but it asks for the folder every time from the root directory  still  there is no intermediate plan for storage  it goes from free to  10  mo for 1 tb  i do not need 1 tb  but i do need something more than the free plan  google drive will be my new storage since they offer an intermediate plan  i asked for something middle of the road but they are not interested  i am going to drop dropbox where it belongs  in the trash box
good but   a download  are continue   but  a any one  call  and any appliation is start   to a browsing speed is slow and cancel    so  founder  solve this my problem     plz
good time waster  good fun  but getting old and spams ads really bad
awesome it is a great game that will test your patience  you may have to spend real money if you cannot wait to move on or lack the skill needed to complete a stage  there are more than 1 000 stages  so far i am up to level 82 and each level has at least 15 stages
bookmarking is no good i used to be able to pick where i bookmarked something when i made it  now it saves default to mobile bookmarks folder and i then have to go find the bookmark and edit it to move it where i want it  also when opening bookmarks list it does not open where i was last  it opens up a random list of bookmarks  it was perfectly fine how it was previously  now its just rediculus
love this app all in one nepalese app
almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers  the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management  that is all i need  i tried firefox  which i use on desktop  as a way of getting away from chrome  because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it  seriously  i hate google  unfortunately  chrome is still hands down the best browser i have used on android  firefox started out fine  but became slower and glitchier as i used it  like everything except chrome  meh
well    i just switched to a new htc phone and now chrome forces closed whenever i am reading mostly text websites  it just happend twice in the span of ten minutes and it is getting annoying  i do not even have other apps running in the background or too many tabs open so i do not know what is going on with it
contacts sync will not work contacts do not sync anymore  app crashes  i have tried uninstalling  clearing data and cache  updating but the issue persist  should not had released this version with so many bugs
still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version  it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app  stop updating things that used to work
thanks for this app loved this app but my one suggestion
totally diferent from the web page do not use this app  use the web page instead  you will be able to do much more from there  it is almost impossible to apply to a job from here
useful and well designed  however glitchy the app is really well designed  however  i have begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either person s end  the app does not record how long the conversation lasted  in fact  it does not show that a call even took place
forgot my old wechat password  i want to reopen old wechat me    but  i forgot my password for wechat old    my old wechat info also incomplete    there is no link with facebook    i have no qq id    telephone numbers also do not update    but i remember my id    how can i go back    please help me
neat nice  smooth  speed but downloading is lacking in speed correct this i will give you 5 star
fb notification turns on automatically even after disabling it and tamil language is not quite clear
